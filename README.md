### Hello!

I have a BEng degree in Technical Physics from AGH University of Technology acquired in February 2022.
Currently I am also doing a BA in Sociology at Jagiellonian University.
During the first half of 2022 I spent 5 months in Porto, Portugal, where I had an opportunity to attend some ML courses.
I plan to pursue a career in widely understood Data Analysis, although I haven't yet decided which part of the industry I want to dive into.
I've been uploading some of the projects I did during my time at AGH or I am still currently doing.

Right now I am looking for an internship in Data Analysis, where I would like to develop my Pythin skills.
